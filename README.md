# CPP-Blackjack
This is my first "big" project for my university. this was at a time when I didn't know what object oriented programming is or how to create your own structures so it looks like this not without a reason. Still I'm pretty proud of what I did because it worked. Right now I would do it 10x more efficiently and better looking.
